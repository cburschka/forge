Installing Forge
================

Requirements:
	* Python 3 : http://www.python.org/
	* GTK+ : http://www.gtk.org/ 
	* PyGObject : https://wiki.gnome.org/PyGObject

Run forge/setup.py. It will ask for a path to the BoA installation.
Currently, only the Windows version of BoA is supported (no resource forks).


Running the Map Viewer
======================

Usage:
  forge/main.py

In the interface, you will be able to open any *.bas file that is in its
proper location; that is, in the same directory with the scenario data script
and all the custom graphics.
